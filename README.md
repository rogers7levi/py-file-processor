# **File Processor**

This Python project automates the organization of files based on their types by classifying them into designated folders. It serves as a simple workflow for managing and organizing files, making it an excellent beginner-friendly project to learn Python concepts like file handling and directory management.

---

## **Features**
- Scans a source folder for files.
- Classifies files into categories based on their extensions:
  - `.txt` files are moved to the **Text/** folder.
  - `.csv` files are moved to the **csv/** folder.
  - Image files (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`) are moved to the **Images/** folder.
- Skips directories and processes only files.
- Handles unknown file types gracefully by logging them as "unknown."

## **Project Structure**
```
file_processor/
├── input_files/          # Source folder containing files to be processed
├── Text/                 # Destination folder for text files
├── Images/               # Destination folder for image files
├── csv/                  # Destination folder for CSV files
├── file_processor.py     # Main script for processing files
```

---

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Standard Python libraries: `os`, `shutil`

---

## **Setup**
1. Clone the repository or download the script to your local machine.
2. Place all files to be processed in the `input_files/` directory.
3. Create the following folders in the project directory (if they don’t already exist):
   - `Text/`
   - `Images/`
   - `csv/`
4. Install Python if you don’t have it already.

---

## **Usage**
1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python file_processor.py
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Process all files in the `input_files/` directory.
   - Move them to their respective folders based on file type.
   - Log a message for unknown file types.

---

## **Example Output**
### Input Files:
- `example.txt`
- `data.csv`
- `cloud.jpeg`
- `README.md`

### Output:
- `Text/`: `example.txt`
- `csv/`: `data.csv`
- `Images/`: `cloud.jpeg`
- **Console Log**:
  ```
  Moved example.txt to Text
  Moved data.csv to csv
  Moved cloud.jpeg to Images
  Unknown file type: cannot move README.md
  ```

---

## **Customization**
You can modify the script to handle additional file types or define custom folders:
1. Edit the `struc` function in `file_processor.py`.
2. Add new `elif` conditions to handle more extensions:
   ```python
   elif extension == '.pdf':
       shutil.move(file_path, os.path.join("PDFs", os.path.basename(file_path)))
       print(f"Moved {file} to PDFs")
   ```

---

## **Learning Goals**
This project introduces the following Python concepts:
- File and directory operations with the `os` and `shutil` modules.
- Conditional logic for file classification.
- Debugging and logging outputs for script validation.

---

## **Future Improvements**
- Add support for recursive folder traversal.
- Implement error handling for cases like file permission issues.
- Allow configuration through a settings file (e.g., `config.json`).
- Extend functionality to compress files after moving them.
